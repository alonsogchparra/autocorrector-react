# Autocorrector (Tiny)

This is a project where you can add the misspelled words with its correction that way you can check on the textarea how it works.

After you write the misspelled word (that you already added to the list or using one on the correction's list) once you press the space button it will fix the misspelled word.

Next to the Textarea you can see the list of the words that already are added.
